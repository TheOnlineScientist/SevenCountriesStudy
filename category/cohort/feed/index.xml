					<description><![CDATA[The average population intake of saturated fat varied between 3% of energy in Japan and 22% of energy in Eastern Finland in the 1960s. There was also a 6-fold range in 25-year CHD mortality rates among the 16 cohorts. The average saturated fat intake at baseline was strongly correlated with 25-year CHD mortality rates.

					<description><![CDATA[In the 1960s average serum cholesterol levels varied from 160 mg/dl (4 mmol/l) in the Japanese cohorts to 270 mg/dl (7 mmol/l) in Eastern Finland. The baseline serum cholesterol levels of the 16 cohorts were positively correlated with the CHD mortality rates after 5, 10, and 25 years. The higher the average serum cholesterol level at baseline  [...]]]></description>

Smoking decreased over time and systolic blood pressure increased except for the East Finland cohort. A decrease of serum cholesterol occurred in Finland and in The Netherlands whereas serum cholesterol increased slightly in Italy, and large in Serbia and Greece.

					<description><![CDATA[In the 1960s, foods were prepared at home and had more fiber than ultra-processed foods produced nowadays. The average intake of starch was correlated (R=0.74) with the average consumption of bread, cereals, legumes and potatoes. The average intake of starch varied from 10 % of energy in the US to more than 50 % of  [...]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dietary sugars consist of mono-and disaccharides and can be divided into naturally occurring sugars present in fruit (glucose and fructose), milk (lactose and galactose), grains (bread and pasta) (maltose) and added sugar (sucrose). In the 1960s traditional Western diets were high in sucrose, while the traditional Mediterranean and Japanese diets were low. The average intake  [...]]]></description>

The 50-year data confirm and extend the 25-year data. Average cohort intake of saturated fatty acids was strongly positively associated with 50-year CHD mortality rates (R = 0.92).
