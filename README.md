Goal of the website

This website seeks to display and explain the background, concepts, methods, and results of the Seven Countries Study, an unique on-going exploration of biology, environment, diet and lifestyle in the cause and prevention of heart attacks and blood vessel diseases. The site is directed particularly to students and professionals in medicine and public health but also is accessible to all readers interested in prevention of these diseases and in healthy aging.
